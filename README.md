# VME Bus System – Verilog Implementation on Vivado

This project presents the **Design and Verification** of a **Versa Module Europa (VME) bus system** using **Verilog HDL** on **Xilinx Vivado 2018.3**. It demonstrates a modular and scalable communication framework capable of handling **multi-master and multi-slave architectures** with a centralized arbiter and efficient memory-mapped data transfers.

## 🔧 What I Built

- ✅ **Master Module**  
  Initiates bus requests, performs read/write operations, and handles control signaling in compliance with VME protocol.

- ✅ **Slave Module**  
  Responds to requests from master(s), manages memory transactions, and handles acknowledgment or error signaling.

- ✅ **Arbiter Module**  
  Regulates access to the shared bus using three arbitration schemes:
  - Round-Robin Arbitration  
  - Priority-Based Arbitration  
  - Single Priority Arbitration

- ✅ **Integrated Bus Architecture**  
  Supports real-time communication through structured handshaking, memory mapping, and control signal coordination across all modules.

## 📌 Key Features

- **Multi-Master Communication** with bus contention resolution  
- **Arbitration Logic** supporting multiple fairness policies  
- **Modular Verilog Design** for Master, Slave, and Arbiter  
- **Memory Mapping & File-Based Transactions** to model real data flow  
- **Finite State Machines (FSMs)** used for protocol implementation and timing control  
- **Bus Utilization and Latency Metrics** analyzed during verification
